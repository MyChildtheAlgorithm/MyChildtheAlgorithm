- 👋 Hi, I’m @MyChildtheAlgorithm
- 👀 I wrote a book about queer single parenting in conversation with a GPT algorithm called My Child, the Algorithm, an alternatively intelligent book of love (Footnote Press)
- 🌱 I’m currently curious about what kind of LLMs we need to generate new thinking, writing, creativity
- 💞️ I am a neuroqueer writer and academic with no coding background looking for collaborators, with the aim of queering LLMs in search of new modes of thinking and writing 
- 📫 How to reach me ... h.silva@qmul.ac.uk @HannahSilvaUK
